The search-buffer is an array of linkedlists. Each entry is the head of a linked list. Note that the list 
doesnt actually store any symbols. For those purposes we use a list. It will be enough for us to just know that
a particular entry in the array of lists corresponds to a particular character. Also really
the lists only purpose is to deal with speeding up searches and managing the window representation.
this increases the storage to q^2 + q^2 but who cares, it will make things cleaner

Constants/Globals 
@:W is the window length (W=2^{N})
@: map is an instance of the map class
#: its is used to translate characters to indices

Private Members
@:buf is the search buffer

Init
@: W
#: Initalizes buf to size W and makes a 





Insertion

#: 

Del
For deletion we will need to maintain a pointer to the character in the text
that is oldest. then when we want to delete a character we look up that character in
the search-buffer and remove it then increment oldest pointer by one
