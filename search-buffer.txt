The search-buffer is an array of linkedlists. Each entry is the head of a linked list. Note that the list 
doesnt actually store any symbols. For those purposes we use a list. It will be enough for us to just know that
a particular entry in the array of lists corresponds to a particular character. Also really
the lists only purpose is to deal with speeding up searches and managing the window representation.
this increases the storage to q^2 + q^2 but who cares, it will make things cleaner
