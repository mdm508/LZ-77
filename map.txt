A map purpose is to create associations between integers and strings from our alphabet.
Note that our alhpabet it yll two letters that are possible to make using only 8 bits.

Requires from bit_function bstr_to_chr

Members
@:M is an array of size 256^2. it contains all the symbols we need


?: should is be a correspondce between i-1 binary number
init
#: generate all the permutations of size 2
#:with repetition from the set of 8 bit binary strs randing from
#:b00000000 to b11111111. Each of these strings are translated
#:to there corresponding chr and then stored in M. 
#:Additionally each string will be stored at its 
#:binary->int in the array. So word 00000000-00000000
#: is stored at index 0 and corresponds to
#: bstr_to_chr(00000000) + bstr_to_chr(00000000)

get OVERLOADED
@:index of the chr str you want to look up
#:returns the symbol at M[index]


get OVERLOADED
@:str the two bit character string that you want to look up
#:return the index associated with str
