bstr_to_chr
@:bstr is a binary str of 8 bits long
#:convert bstr into its character representation 

chr_to_bstr
@:chr is a character literal
#:convert chr to its 8 bit binary representation

encode_offsetlen
@:offset_len an integer reprsesenting the encode_offset
@:N  number of bits to use in encoding
#:transform offset_len into its bit representation  

encode_matchlen
@:match_len an integer representing match length
@:L number of bits to use in encoding 
#:transform match_len to bit representation of (match_len - 1)

encode_strlen
@:str_len is an integer representing length of unmatched characters
@:S is the number of bits to use in encoding, (longest match is 2^(S) - 1)

encode_eof
@:L is nuumber of bits to use in the encoding of (0)
@:S is number of bits to use in encoding (0)
#:produces a special pair (0,0) which denotes the end of file
#:the binary str produced will be of length L + S
 
join_bits OVERLOADED
@:bit_offset_len a N bit binary str denoting offset lenth
@:bit_match_len an L bit binary str denoting match length
#:join two bit strings together to emulate (len,offset) pair to
#: get a N + L bit binary string

join_bits OVERLOADED
@:bit_code_len is an L bit binary represntation of 0
@:bit_str_len: is an S bit string denonting the number of characters 
@: that were not matched in the look ahead buffer. (usally 1)
@:str is a string literal of up to S characters terminated by null character
#:join bit_code_len,bit_str_len, and str to emulate (code,strlen,chars) pair
#: get a L + S + len(str) binary/char str
